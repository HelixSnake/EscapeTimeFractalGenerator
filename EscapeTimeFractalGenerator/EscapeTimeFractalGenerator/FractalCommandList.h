//Command list layout:
//each command is 6 blocks wide
//stored as the following
//[command enum] [command type] [argument 1 type] [argument 1 index] [argument 2 type] [argument 2 index]

//Data is stored in 4 arrays (not in this class), the argument types and command types will refer to these arrays
//variable floats: 0
//variable complex floats: 1
// 
//constant floats: 2
//constant complex floats: 3
//
// [command type] will be 0, or 1, corresponding to these arrays. [argument type] can be any of the four numbers.
// if a command is only has one input, [argument 2 type] and [argument 2 index] will be ignored and set to 0.
// Data for variables (non constants) will be stored in arrays with the same length as the command tree, with data only stored and used once every 7 entries. Wasted space, but it's faster and easier to keep track of, and they shouldn't be that long anyways.
// Every time a command is executed, the result will be stored in same spot at the beginning of that command chunk, in the array of variables corresponding to the command type.
// Argument indexes should either be 1. the position of a previous command, and the same type as that command type was, or 2. the index of a constant in one of the constants arrays, if the type points to a constant array.
// index 0 of the constant complex floats array is reserved for the complex float formed from the x y pixel position.
