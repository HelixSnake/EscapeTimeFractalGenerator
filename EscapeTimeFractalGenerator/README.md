# Escape Time Fractal Renderer
Practice project for C++. Designed to render escape time fractals on the CPU.
## Introduction
This was a personal project I made to practice C++. Fractals have always fascinate me, how incredibly complex patterns emerge from simple inputs. This project was designed both as a fun toy for me to play with, a practice ground for C++, and good content for my programming blog.

## Technologies:
GLEW
GLFW3
GLM
Dear ImGui
SOIL
IMFileBrowser

## Installation Instructions
In order to make this project work, you'll need to populate the lib/ directory with the submodules. To do this, run the following command in the base folder:
`git submodule update --init --recursive`
Currently this project is only designed to be ran on Windows.

## Features
